Hi!  This is a side project that I have been working on to make sure I stay in practice with what I learn in coding bootcamp as well.  In other words, it's a work in progress.

**Purpose**
This is just a basic landing page, where a crafting expert can write blogs about their experiences with crafting and what they love about the hobby.

**Functions/Dependencies**
Given that this is a static page, there's not too much dependencies, other than a script.js file containing a function to increase the number of likes per post every time the "like" button is clicked.

If you click on the big subscribe button, you will be taken to a page to enter your contact information...that is still a work in progress so the information won't be going anywhere.  The only thing that will happen is that you will get an alert that says "Great! Thanks for subscribing."

**Build/Deploy instructions**
